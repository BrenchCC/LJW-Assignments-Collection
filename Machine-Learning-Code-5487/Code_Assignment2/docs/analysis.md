### Qualitative Analysis of Clustering Algorithms

#### **K-means Algorithm**
• **Performance Analysis**:
  - Dataset A (spherical clusters): Demonstrated moderate effectiveness, though not fully realizing its theoretical advantage for spherical distributions
  - Dataset B (non-spherical clusters): Significant performance degradation, showing poorest adaptation to complex shapes
  - Dataset C (complex structures): Surprisingly achieved best performance among the three algorithms

• **Key Advantages**: Computational efficiency and straightforward implementation make it suitable for scenarios with compact, uniformly distributed data
• **Main Limitations**: Strict spherical cluster assumptions lead to poor performance on non-spherical structures; exhibits moderate stability with noticeable cross-dataset variations

#### **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
• **Performance Analysis**:
  - Dataset A: Achieved near-perfect segmentation, demonstrating excellent adaptation to Gaussian-distributed data
  - Dataset B: Moderate performance, superior to K-means but inferior to Mean Shift
  - Dataset C: Significant performance decline, showing weakest adaptation to complex structures

• **Key Advantages**: Excellent performance on Gaussian-distributed data; provides probabilistic framework for soft assignments
• **Main Limitations**: Heavy reliance on Gaussian assumptions leads to performance degradation on non-Gaussian distributions; shows highest sensitivity to initialization and parameter settings

#### **Mean Shift Algorithm**
• **Performance Analysis**:
  - Dataset A: Excellent performance, comparable to GMM
  - Dataset B: Best performance among all algorithms, demonstrating strong adaptation to non-spherical clusters
  - Dataset C: Moderate performance, only slightly lower than K-means

• **Key Advantages**: Non-parametric nature provides strong adaptability to various cluster shapes; most stable across different datasets; automatically determines cluster count
• **Main Limitations**: High sensitivity to bandwidth parameters; higher computational complexity; performance decline on extremely complex structures

## (c) Sensitivity Analysis of Mean Shift to Bandwidth Parameter

### Bandwidth Sensitivity Characteristics

1. **Critical Sensitivity Range**: The algorithm demonstrates extreme sensitivity in lower bandwidth ranges, where minor parameter changes cause dramatic variations in clustering outcomes
2. **Optimal Parameter Zone**: Exists a stable bandwidth range where the algorithm achieves consistent, high-quality results
3. **Performance Transition**: Transition from over-segmentation (small bandwidth) to under-segmentation (large bandwidth) follows theoretical expectations

### Practical Implications

• **Parameter Selection Strategy**: Requires systematic bandwidth exploration, particularly focusing on the transition zone between over- and under-segmentation
• **Stability Consideration**: While sensitive to parameter choice, the algorithm demonstrates robust performance within the optimal bandwidth range
• **Application Guidance**: Recommends starting with smaller bandwidth values and gradually increasing while monitoring cluster count stability

**Conclusion**: The Mean Shift algorithm exhibits significant bandwidth sensitivity, particularly in specific parameter ranges. However, with careful parameter tuning, it can achieve excellent clustering performance across diverse data structures.

# Problem 2: Image Segmentation

## (a) Comparative Analysis of Segmentation Algorithms

### Algorithm Performance Characteristics

#### 1. Segmentation Quality and Application Context

• **K-means**: Produces clear segment boundaries with high computational efficiency, but tends to oversimplify texture details; optimal for rapid, straightforward segmentation tasks
• **GMM**: Better captures gradient transitions and preserves detail complexity, though with increased computational demands; suitable for detail-sensitive applications
• **Mean Shift**: Naturally adapts to image structures with superior edge preservation, but requires careful parameter tuning; ideal for boundary-critical segmentation

#### 2. Feature Space Considerations

• Color-only features tend to ignore spatial relationships, potentially leading to fragmented results
• Combined color-position features significantly improve spatial coherence across all algorithms
• Mean Shift demonstrates best object integrity preservation with spatial features

#### 3. Parameter Sensitivity Ranking

• **Highest Sensitivity**: Mean Shift (bandwidth parameters)
• **Moderate Sensitivity**: K-means (cluster count K)
• **Lowest Sensitivity**: GMM (most stable to parameter variations)

### Practical Recommendations

1. **Algorithm Selection Guide**:
   - K-means: Time-sensitive applications with simple segmentation needs
   - GMM: Detail-preserving segmentation with stable performance
   - Mean Shift: Boundary-precise segmentation with adequate tuning resources

2. **Feature Strategy**: Incorporate spatial features for object coherence; consider texture features for complex patterns

3. **Implementation Approach**: GMM provides best balance of quality and stability; choose based on specific application constraints

## (b) Feature Scaling Strategies for K-means and Mean Shift

### K-means Feature Scaling
Scaling spatial features (divided by λ) effectively adjusts the relative importance of spatial versus color information:

• λ > 1: Emphasizes spatial compactness in clustering
• λ < 1: Prioritizes color uniformity in segment formation

### Mean Shift Feature Scaling
Independent scaling of color (h_c) and spatial (h_p) bandwidths provides dual control:

• Smaller scaling factors increase feature sensitivity, producing finer segmentation details
• Larger factors create smoother, more generalized segments

### Expected Outcomes
Feature scaling enables:

• Balanced trade-off between color and spatial considerations in K-means
• Independent control over color and spatial smoothness in Mean Shift
• Customized segmentation results adapted to specific image characteristics:
  - Increased color weight for texture-rich images
  - Enhanced spatial emphasis for structurally complex images
  - Adjusted bandwidth parameters for detail preservation needs

This scaling approach allows more precise alignment of algorithm behavior with specific segmentation objectives and image characteristics.
